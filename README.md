#### Introduction
Simple at it seems, this small, minimal and simple tool <b>let you play GTA Online alone into a generic public sessions.</b><br>
It simple blocks some ports on which the Rockstar Server rely on, letting you enjoy your activities alone into a public room.<br>

#### Usage
Things never been simpler:
* Click <b>Release</b> (or click [Here](https://github.com/Asynchronousx/GTA5-Online-Public-Solo-Session/releases) to be redirected)
* Scroll down and download <b>GTA5PublicSoloSession.exe</b> from the release page
* Open your download folder, right click and "<b>Run as Administrator</b>". This is necessary because to block the rockstar ports it needs the administrator rights.
* Press <b>Enable</b> and run GTA Online to join a public solo session. If you forgot to press Enable before running GTA:Online, just enter the public lobby, Alt+Tab and Enable the solo session from the application, then find a new session. Boom, you're alone!<br>

Alternatively, if you want to build it from scratch:
* Download the whole repo (Clone or Download -> Download as Zip)
* Open you Visual Studio 201* version (2017 or above), make sure to </b>Run as Administrator</b>
* Open the folder where <b>GTA5PublicSoloSession.sln</b> is located and open it as a project solution
* Run the debug/release, and use the application.


#### Security
The .exe file in the release is encrypted with SHA256RSA and with auth token. Obviously, neither the manifesto nor the key are into this repository. Feel free to scan the file aswell.

#### Will I get banned for using this?
<b>Absolutely NO!</b> Firewall blockage and rules are <b>EXTERNAL</b> from any GTA5 files.
